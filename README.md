# Intermediate-colleges-in-Pakistan-EDA
## Project Overview
The Intermediate Colleges of Pakistan EDA project entails analyzing educational data from across Pakistan to identify performance trends and regional disparities among intermediate colleges. The aim is to dissect factors such as academic results, faculty quality, and resources to highlight areas needing improvement. This analysis seeks to inform targeted interventions to bridge educational gaps between different regions, ultimately enhancing the national education standard.
## Data Description
The dataset used for this project comprises information on intermediate colleges in Pakistan. The data includes the following key features:

College Name: The name of the intermediate college.
Location: The geographical location of the college, including city and province details.
Study Program: The various academic programs offered by the college, such as FSC (Engineering, Medical), ICS (Computer Science), ICom, FA (General Science, Arts), etc.
Sector: The sector to which the college belongs, either Public or Private.
Affiliation: The affiliating body or university to which the college is affiliated, if any.
Rating: The rating of the college, typically on a scale from 0 to 5 stars, which reflects the quality and performance of the college.
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

To analyze the distribution of intermediate colleges across Pakistan, a region column was added to categorize colleges into six regions: Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK), Islamabad, Sindh, Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), and Balochistan. The results indicate significant regional disparities, with Punjab having the highest concentration of colleges at 818, followed by KPK with 124, Islamabad with 90, Sindh and AJK each with 28, and Balochistan with 9 colleges. This distributional analysis provides valuable insights into the geographical spread of intermediate education institutions in Pakistan, highlighting areas where educational resources and infrastructure may be more concentrated or lacking.

Further analysis was conducted to examine the distribution of colleges by sector (public and private) within each region. Punjab emerged with the highest number of private sector colleges, while Balochistan had a greater representation of public sector colleges. This observation underscores regional variations in the governance and funding models of intermediate education institutions across Pakistan.

The dataset includes information on affiliations and study programs offered by intermediate colleges. Among 51 affiliated private sector colleges and 23 public sector colleges, affiliations play a crucial role in determining educational standards and resource allocation. Analysis of the top 20 study programs revealed that FA, FSC, and ICS are the most prevalent programs offered, highlighting the educational preferences and academic focus areas within intermediate education in Pakistan.
